Basic CI/CD Integration using Git & GitHub
(It's configured inside Zorin OS 15.3)


>>> Objecttives
>>> Clone GitHub Repo to a local machine's directory,
>>> Create a new Git branch.
>>> Make changes & commit it to another branch in Git
>>> Push that new branch to the remote GitHub repo
>>> Push a local Git repo to the "main" branch remote GitHub repo

>>> Create a submodule of git clone


1. Initialize git inside the directory
	git init

2. Create & switch to a new git branch ("clone_branch")
	git checkout -b clone_branch main

3. Create remote which will connect, pull & push to remote GitHub repo
	git remote add origin https://github.com/Ashraf840/Git-Github-Tutorials.git

4. As the local directory has previously got a ".git" file inside of it, the we need to clone the GitHub repo as a submodule inside the local machine
	git submodule add https://github.com/Ashraf840/Git-Github-Tutorials.git

5. Now check the status of the file
	git status

6. Add all the files to git so that it can track the files
	git add .

7. Commit the changes inside git
	git commit -m "Cloned from GitHub into local Git"

8. Push this commit to remote repository's "clone_branch_submodule"
	git push -u origin clone_branch_submodule
