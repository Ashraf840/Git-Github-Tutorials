1. To use multiple github account credentails, a better approach would be asking for the signin credentials every time a user want to push to a specific github repo.

2. For that, we need to make a configuration in the global scope of the git in that machine.
        git config --global credential.useHTttpPath true

3. Then make another remote for the separate github account consisting of the github repo-url.
        git remote add origin_another_remoteName github_repo_url_path

4. Try to push using the following cmd.
        git push -u origin_another_remoteName

[ NB ]  Before pushing by following the step-4, check if a personal access token is created for that account, if not, then generate one 
    access token for 7days with least privilege.

5. For git pull (rebase), use the following command.
    git pull --rebase origin branchName
