########## Branching & Merging


Scenario:
>  Suppose there are two branches in the local git repository. One branch has some updates & pushed in a GitHub account.
    Another branch is used to push in a separate GitHub account. The elegant way of updating the other local git branch,
    is to use the "git merge" cmd.



Steps:
1. Make updates to the current local git branch.
    ( NB ): Try to push that updates to the desired GitHub account repo.

2. Switch to the branch which needs to be updated according to the updated branch. Use the following cmd.
        git checkout branchName

3. Use the gti merge cmd along with the updatedBranchName. Use the following cmd.
        git merge updatedBranchname
