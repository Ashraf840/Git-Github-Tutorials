#### Rollback to Previous Git Commit
Check the git commit logs in local repository. From that, get the first 7 DIGITS OF THE COMMIT & use the following cmd to rollback to a specific commit.
    git reset commitID

[Shortcut]: To rollback to the previous immediate commit without knowing the commit ID from the log.
    git reset head~1
[Note]: "~1" refers to the number of commits backward to which the code tree will revert.





#### Restoring deleted files in Git
After deleting a file accidenlty, & immediately realize that it was a mistake, use the cmd along with the deleted fileName.
    git ckeckout HEAD fileName

[Note]: This will work regardless of whether the deletion was staged or not.

#### I deleted a file and committed the deletion
[Personal Approach]: Rollback to the previous commit using the "git reset ....." cmd, subsequently, restore the deleted file using the following cmd.
    git reset HEAD~1   OR,    git reset commitID
    git checkout HEAD fileName
