#### Rollback to Previous Git Commit
Check the git commit logs in local repository. From that, get the first 7 DIGITS OF THE COMMIT & use the following cmd to rollback to a specific commit.
    git reset commitID

[Shortcut]: To rollback to the previous immediate commit without knowing the commit ID from the log.
    git reset head~1
